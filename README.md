# Summary materials for the state exam from Open Informatics, Basics of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.

I made these originally in Notion and exported them to Markdown.

The Notion repository is available [here](https://www.notion.so/203eef54e4d280a6948befe59b4fd836?v=203eef54e4d280a6a058000ca7159c16&source=copy_link).

If you have an improvement/edit/clarification, please open an issue or a pull request.

Adjustments may be needed when the 2025 refresh of the program comes into effect.

Note: Software-related courses may not be as detailed as the others, they tend to appear in the exam less frequently.

Please check the [official requirements](ga-oi-bachelor-state-exam-topics-2023-05-03.pdf).

Good luck!
